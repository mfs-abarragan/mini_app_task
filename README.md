# Mini App Task
by Alexander Barrag√°n

## Description
This a simple one-screen Flutter app that features a list of dropdown items fetched from a simulated API call.

## Considerations
- I left the call with my recruiter under the impression that I would have two days to complete the task. I didn't know it was actually a timed task and when I started the assessment, I didn't have the availability to complete this task.
- I asked my recruiter for permission to complete it out of Coodesh. Permission was granted.
- No IA tools like LLMs were used to complete this task as shown on the attached videos
- Documentation and own notes were used, though.
- I was unable to save the original instructions for the task before exiting from the Coodesh platform, si this task was completed under many assumtioms originated from what I remember about those instructions.

## Details
- API call simulation works thorugh a Future.delayed and a local json as a mock response.
- No configs for http or dio were actually coded but they were mentioned, considered and described in the attached videos.
- Each dropdown item allows the user to mark it as favourite.
- Favourites do not persist because of lack of time to implemented shared_preferences. However, a description on how I wuld have approached that functionality is included on the attached videos.
- Searchbar was not implemented because of lack of time.
- All state management was handled through Riverpod providers.
- A custom clean architecture effort was done to keep a maintainable project structure. It was designed under the assumption that the item list would be only one module of a growing app.
- UI was clearly separated from business logic and any other type logic.

## Video recordings of the development of the task

## Last annotations

I appreciate your felxibility. I tried to be as transparent as possible about the resources I used and definitely did not use AI, which would have interestingly -and probably- enabled me to finish the task within the given 80 minutes. I hope this helps you determine whether we could be a successful match or not. 

Have a nice day!
